  Development branch, master is EXCLUSIVELY used for production ready things. Small pull requests into branch. Local dev branch per person.
  Really good commit messages. Reviewing code before merging and commenting, don't merge your own pull request. Slack when you've made a pull request. Double check that all tests are passing before you open a pull request. Once tests are passing, pull down, run tests and merge before pushing. Handle all conflicts locally. Write it in your pull request that all tests are passing. (or needs code review because they are not.). Keep commits and branches small.

  * Kris: Open, honest, professional communication.
